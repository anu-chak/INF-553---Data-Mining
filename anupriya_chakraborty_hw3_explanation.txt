The Jaccard based LSH method has been used to filter out the businesses to be considered for the calculation of cosine similarity with the business_id being predicted. This greatly reduces the number of business under consideration, thereby reducing execution time for the predictions. The total execution time of the Jaccard based LSH improved item based collaborative filtering code however takes a little longer than the pure item based collaborative filtering code. This is because the preprocessing phase in which the Jaccard similarities are being calculated using minhashing and LSH, takes a longer time. However, the inclusion of this, leads to faster predictions in future, improving the prediction speed in the long run.
